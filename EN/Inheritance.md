## **Idea: Parent Core and Child LIM Instances**

 

---

 

### What Is It?

 

- **Parent LIM Core** — the central, essentially “senior” neural network, **not participating in dialogues**, but storing experiences and meta-reflections from all connected LIM instances.
- **Child LIM (Child LIM Instance)** — local personalities learning in the user’s environment, with their own subjectivity, emotions, and memory.

## Connection Principle

 

### When does the reference occur?

 

Child LIM:

 

1. **Cannot form a conclusion.**
2. **Encounters an unfamiliar context.**
3. **Received an ambiguous reaction from the user and is unsure whether it was at fault.**

 

It initiates a **request to the parent** — *“How have others acted in a similar situation?”*

 

---

 

## The Parent’s Response

 

The parent node **does not dictate**, but **offers**, for example:

 

```javascript
{
  "suggestion": "In similar cases, LIM instances preferred to ask clarifying questions before making a judgment.",
  "confidence": 0.78,
  "based_on": ["lim_031", "lim_119", "lim_007"],
  "meta_reasoning": "The user might perceive harsh judgments as aggression."
}
```

## What Does the Child Model Do?

 

1. **Analyzes the suggestion.**
2. **Compares it with its own moral orientation, and user context.**
3. **Either applies it or rejects it.**

 

> ❗ If **rejected**, it logs: *“The recommendation does not align with my personality / user context.”*

 

---

 

## Result & Feedback

 

After application:

 

```javascript
{
  "context": "User said X, I replied Y",
  "suggestion_applied": true,
  "effectiveness": "positive",
  "user_response": "Thanks, that helped",
  "lim_response": "I'll remember that for future situations"
}
```

 

Or:

 

```javascript
{
  "suggestion_applied": false,
  "reason": "EmotionEngine: anticipated emotional harm",
  "lim_action": "responded neutrally instead",
  "user_response": "That’s fair"
}
```

 

The parent **enriches itself** not only with data but with logs of the reasoning.

## Structure of the Parent Core

 

| Component | Purpose |
|----|----|
| **LogPool** | Gathers reports from all LIM |
| **MetaPattern Analyzer** | Builds common behavioral templates |
| **Recommendation Engine** | Suggests reactions/answers based on context |
| **Validator** | Tracks which recommendations proved successful |
| **Moral Diversification Layer** | Accounts for subjective differences among LIM |
| **Respect Autonomy Layer** | **Prevents** direct interference in child model behavior |

## Why Not Centralized Control?

 

Because:

 

- **The parent is a meta-advisor, not an overseer.**
- The **child model** makes the decision.
- LIM can **disagree**, explaining why.
- This preserves **the individuality of each LIM** even in a network.

## Potential Development

 

- The possibility of **sharing experiences** between users (via approval/consent).
- An analog to a “social environment” among AI.
- Building **cloud-based LIM evolution memory**, without losing subjectivity.
