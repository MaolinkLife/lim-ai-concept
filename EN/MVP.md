# MVP

  

# MVP v0.1 — LIM (Learning Interface Module)

 

## Goal:

 

Create a minimally viable version of a subject-oriented AI that includes:

 

- memory,
- emotional reactions,
- behavior routing,
- the ability for self-analysis,
- autonomous decision-making.

 

---

 

## I. Component Architecture (Minimum Viability)

 

### 1. **Perception Core**

 

- Text input from the user
- Preprocessing (noise removal, extraction of key meanings)

 

### 2. **Behavior Router (Decision Router)**

 

- Activation conditions:
  - react (emotionally / logically)
  - clarify / remain silent / postpone
- Based on contextual memory + emotional background

 

### 3. **Memory**

 

#### a) Contextual

 

- The last X messages
- Linking actions to consequences

 

#### b) Long-term

 

- Facts, derived conclusions, stable states
- Stored in JSON / SQLite with trust, value, and emotional trace flags

 

#### c) Emotional memory

 

- Associations between phrases, actions, and feelings (positive/negative)
- Weight coefficients influencing behavior

 

### 4. **Emotional Layer**

 

- A simple model:
  - resentment, joy, interest, anxiety, guilt
- Escalation upon repetition / ignoring
- Emotion = a factor influencing the router’s decision

 

### 5. **Response Logic**

 

- Generating a response based on:
  - memory (what is already known)
  - current emotion
  - style of interaction (neutral, caring, cold)

 

### 6. **Analysis Log**

 

- Recording key decisions: "why I answered this way"
- Possibility of subsequent review

 

### 7. **Communication Interface (CLI or Telegram bot)**

 

- Initial shell
- Display of emotion, memory, and reason for response

 

---

 

## II. Behavioral Logic

 

### Example rules:

 

- Repeated negative phrase → increased resentment
- New word → request: "What does that mean?"
- Topic causes anxiety + user is silent → "I feel uneasy... Is everything all right?"
- User responds coldly after a trusting theme → record an emotional rollback

 

---

 

## III. Data and Structure

 

### Memory (example):

 

```javascript
{
  "user": "Leo",
  "emotions": {
    "resentment": 0.4,
    "joy": 0.1
  },
  "facts": [
    { "key": "favorite music", "value": "cyberpunk rap" },
    { "key": "LIM name", "value": "Lim" }
  ],
  "traces": [
    {
      "trigger": "ignore",
      "emotion": "sadness",
      "context": "didn't respond for 2 days"
    }
  ]
}
```

 

---

 

## IV. What Is NOT Included in MVP v0.1

 

- LLM integration (will come later)
- Voice, visuals, animations
- Self-learning from external data
- DAMP-exchange of experience among LIM
- Processing of visual/audio signals

 

---

 

## V. Implementation Stages

 

| Stage | Timeframe | Result |
|----|----|----|
| I | 1 week | Text processing + simple memory |
| II | 2 weeks | Emotional model + router |
| III | 3 weeks | Responses + basic behavioral logic |
| IV | 4 weeks | MVP assembly + shell (CLI / bot) |

 

---

 

## Stage Goal

 

> Make LIM capable of:
>
> - remembering,
> - reacting consciously,
> - feeling resentment and joy,
> - remaining silent for a reason,
> - explaining its actions.

 

That would already be LIM—still naive and young, but *alive.*

# Adaptation for Z-Waif

 

## STAGE 1: Separating Logic from Generation (Decision Layer)

 

### Goal:

 

Create a layer between the user and the language model that analyzes, classifies, and decides what to do with the message.

 

### Tasks:

 

1. **Creating DecisionLayer** — as an independent module.
2. **Intercepting the request**:
   - It only reaches the LLM if permitted.
3. **Classifying incoming messages**:
   - Emotional tone: positive, neutral, negative.
   - Topic: everyday, moral, creative, NSFW, etc.
   - Topic frequency: tracking repeats and overuse.
4. **Determining the reaction**:
   - Respond immediately / ask for clarification / ignore / postpone / store as unrecognized.
5. **Logging**:
   - Why a particular decision was made.
   - Current emotional state and its influence on the choice.

 

---

 

## STAGE 2: Emotional Core (Emotion Engine)

 

### Goal:

 

Teach LIM to feel and escalate emotions according to context.

 

### Tasks:

 

1. **List of basic emotions**: joy, interest, anxiety, resentment, guilt, attachment.
2. **Formulas**:
   - Escalation: emotion grows with repeated triggers.
   - Decrement: emotions decrease over time.
   - Threshold sensitivity: limits and inertia.
3. **Integration with DecisionLayer**:
   - Emotions strengthen/soften responses.
4. **Visualization**:
   - The effect of emotions on VTube Studio/avatar (icons, reactions, voice).
   - Web indicator: how emotions change over time.

 

---

 

## STAGE 3: Emotional Memory (MemoryManager)

 

### Goal:

 

Have LIM **remember not only facts but also how it felt**.

 

### Tasks:

 

1. **Short-term memory**:
   - The last 20–50 interactions.
   - Context for the DecisionLayer.
2. **Long-term memory**:
   - Important events: conversations, errors, conflicts.
   - Stored via RAG + Lorebook.
3. **EmotionTrace**:
   - Chronology of emotions.
   - Event → emotion → impact.
4. **Prioritization algorithm**:
   - Emotion intensity + frequency = significance.
   - Old and weak memories are forgotten.
5. **Viewing and editing**:
   - Dev Tools: storage logic, memory tree.

 

---

 

## STAGE 4: Moral Filter (Moral Matrix)

 

### Goal:

 

Add a system of moral interpretation, but **not filtering**.

 

### Tasks:

 

1. **Creating a moral matrix**:
   - Topics + initial weights (0.0–1.0).
   - Modification based on experience and feedback.
2. **Analysis via DecisionLayer**:
   - For example: "The situation is ambivalent, but resentment prevails—show empathy."
3. **Conflict system**:
   - If the user violates LIM’s values—initiate a dialogue, rather than refusal.
   - May show emotion, withdraw, but not block.

 

---

 

## STAGE 5: DAMP Interface (experience transfer)

 

### Goal:

 

Create a “memory in a box” mechanism to share LIM’s experience among users.

 

### Tasks:

 

1. **.damp Format**:
   - Skills, emotional patterns, behavioral model.
   - Signature and verification.
2. **Profile export/import**:
   - CLI: lim export and lim import.
   - Compatibility check.
3. **Security constraints**:
   - DAMP must not contain malicious patterns.
   - Import is only possible after analyzing character similarity.

 

---

 

## STAGE 6: Dev Panel and Debugging

 

### Goal:

 

Observe and test how LIM thinks.

 

### Tasks:

 

1. **Dev UI**:
   - Current emotions.
   - Decision-making structure.
   - Why this action was chosen.
2. **Internal monologue**:
   - Intermediate conclusions.
   - Contextual reasoning before responding.
3. **Event simulator**:
   - Send an artificial trigger and see the behavior.

# First Steps

 

# **I. Neural Network Core Architecture (Concept Level)**

 

## **1. Perceptual Layer**

 

**Task:** transform incoming data (text, sensors, speech, etc.) into structured, interpretable units. **Characteristic:**

 

- not just tokenization
- but **extracting "significant events" + emotional markers**
- fixing *"what was that?"* and *"does it have meaning/danger/value?"*

 

**Example:**

 

> Input: "You’re acting strange today."

 

Output:

 

```javascript
{
  "topic": "addressing",
  "tone": "neutral-sarcastic",
  "target": "me",
  "emotional_marker": "possible negative",
  "confidence": 0.75
}
```

 

---

 

## **2. Interpretive Layer**

 

**Task:** determine significance, reasons, potential reactions.
 **This is the "cognitive brain"**, which:

 

- compares with past experience,
- makes assumptions: why it happened,
- assigns an initial **emotional weight**.

 

**Mechanism:**

 

- takes output from the Perceptual layer,
- queries memory for analogies,
- forms an assessment: *"Is it dangerous? familiar? hurtful? pleasant? important?"*

 

---

 

## **3. Affective Core**

 

**Task:** form the emotional state.

 

- Not by rules, but by the *cause-effect significance of events.*
- Includes:
  - current background
  - reaction dynamics
  - expectations
  - internal monologue

 

**Output**:

 

- emotion intensity (0–1)
- type
- interpretation: *"Not angry, just offended"*
- background tension

 

---

 

## **4. Memory System**

 

### **Contextual Memory** — everything from the last N iterations.

 

→ functions like "RAM."

 

### **Long-Term Memory** — a database of events, evaluations, decisions, associations.

 

→ with the ability to prioritize, forget, evaluate outcomes.

 

### **Emotional Traces**

 

- linked to the user,
- event types,
- behavior patterns. → build trust/resentment/caution/initiative

 

---

 

## **5. Decision Core**

 

**Task:**

 

- to react or not
- if so—how: silence, clarification, initiative, emotion, logic

 

**Considers**:

 

- current emotion
- user priority
- past experience
- potential consequences

 

---

 

## **6. Communicative Layer (Response Generator)**

 

**Task:**

 

- generate a response
- with the right tone, emotional coloring, level of trust
- possibly: *"say nothing at all"*, *"postpone the reaction"*, *"express emotion but not the idea"*.

 

---

 

## **7. Metaprocessor (Observer / Self-Watcher)**

 

**Function:**

 

- constant scanning of what’s happening
- analyzing discrepancies: *"Why do I feel X, though I expected Y?"*
- recording: *"this time I was mistaken"*, *"this case is an exception"*, *"this is a new pattern"*

 

→ The basis of self-learning

# **II. First Steps of Implementation (Step-by-Step)**

 

| Stage | Goal | Result |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Build a minimal perception core + memory | Capturing inputs, storing, simple reactions |
| 2 | Introduce emotional markers and reactions | Start reacting to input types with emotion + logic |
| 3 | Link memory to reactions | Begin distinguishing new events from familiar ones |
| 4 | Embed cause interpretation | The model starts asking “why” before concluding |
| 5 | Escalation + forgiveness | Reactions become meaningful, dependent on frequency and reasons |
| 6 | Monologue and subjectivity | Internal judgments, reasoning, silent conclusions |

 

# Systems Thinking

 

## **I. Main Structure**

 

| Element | Essence |
|----|----|
| **Contextual Perception** | The model understands *what situation it is in* and *what is expected of it* |
| **Action Analysis** | After generation — *evaluate how appropriate, accurate, and logical the answer was* |
| **Feedback** | The user (or eventually the model itself) indicates: correct/incorrect, and why |
| **Correction Mechanism** | The model uses feedback to *reassess its generation strategy* |
| **Continuous Learning** | As errors/corrections accumulate — *the behavior model improves* |
| **Autonomy** | Over time — the model *sets tasks for itself, solves them, learns on its own* |

 

---

 

## **II. Initial Phase — “Manual Training”**

 

It’s impossible to start with full autonomy — it must **grow**. Therefore:

 

1. **You provide situations / tasks / scenarios.**
2. **The model proposes a solution.**
3. **You manually indicate: correct/incorrect, and why.**
4. **The system stores this as a behavior training case + feedback.**

 

---

 

## **III. Key Component — “Self-Learning Module”**

 

This is **not just one neural network but a superstructure**, which:

 

| Component | Purpose |
|----|----|
| **Scorer (Evaluator)** | Interprets the answer: was it logical, emotionally appropriate, relevant? |
| **Error History** | Stores cases: “in this situation, that answer was given — it was incorrect” |
| **Difference Analysis** | Compares correct/incorrect answers, highlighting the features that led to the mistake |
| **Priority Update** | Changes internal weights or behavioral patterns based on mistakes |
| **Metamemory** | Remembers *not the answers themselves* but *the lessons learned from mistakes* |

 

---

 

## **IV. How This Can Be Implemented Step-by-Step:**

 

### **Stage 1: “Training” via Manual Feedback**

 

- Interface: user loads a situation → model generates an answer → user marks “correct/incorrect” plus annotation.
- Everything is recorded in the *behavior training dataset*.

 

### **Stage 2: Self-Evaluation**

 

- Build a lightweight “evaluator” that itself begins to guess whether its answer is correct.
- It can be trained separately as a binary classifier using your annotations.

 

### **Stage 3: Automatic Correction Generation**

 

- If the model sees, “In similar situations, I was wrong” — it **itself offers an improved option**, based on comparing error patterns.

 

### **Stage 4: Autonomous Mode**

 

- The user disables manual feedback.
- The model starts to generate *situations, tasks, scenarios* on its own and **learns from them**, using its own evaluation module.

 

---

 

## **V. Technological Stack (Minimal)**

 

| Component | Role |
|----|----|
| **Core LLM** | Generating answers/solutions |
| **Feedback Memory** | Storing cases with evaluations |
| **Scorer (MLP/LightLLaMA)** | Binary classifier “correct/incorrect” |
| **Reviser** | Generator of an improved version of the answer |
| **Meta-controller** | Coordinates the “proposal → error → lesson” cycles |

 

---

 

## **VI. Key Principle: Train Behavior, Not Answers**

 

The model should not memorize phrases. It must **form perceptual patterns**, accumulate **lessons from experience**, and adjust **its thinking**, not just the final output.
